1. Finish the program started in class.

Write a C++ program that reads the contents of a text file line-by-line while printing them out 

to the screen. In other words, the program reads one line from a text file and then prints it out 

to the screen. Then, it goes to the next line and so on until there are no more lines to read.

Then, the program stops.

The name of the file to be read must be supplied as a command line argument.

Use the program makeLED.cpp as a guide for C++ style.

Name your program reading_file.cpp.

2. Write a C++ program that writes the following lines to a file.

I watched the movie Star Wars I.

I watched the movie Star Trek.

The name of the file to be written to must be supplied as a command line argument.

Use the program makeLED.cpp as a guide for C++ style.

Name your program writing_file.cpp.
